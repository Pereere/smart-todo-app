The Smart Todo App is a React App that enables you to keep track of your daily activities in a smart way. </br>
<h2> <b> What Can You Do With The Smart Todo App? </b> </h2> </br>

The Smart Todo App allows you to do the following:
1. <b> Create a new todo </b> activity as an item and see all the todo items created
2. <b> Edit the created Todo items </b> and update them with the update button
3. <b> Check a Todo item as completed </b>, and have the completed effects applied
4. And, to <b> delete a Todo item </b> if you don't need it anymore with the delete button

<h2> <b> What are the Languages, Libraries, and Tools Used </b> </h2>

The Smart Todo App is built these:

1. <b> React | </b> A javaScript library. 
2. <b> React Redux | <b> A a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
3. <b> Redux ToolKit | </b> An official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
4. <b> TypeScript | </b> A more handy tool that is strongly typed, object oriented, and compiled language.
5. <b> SCSS | </b> For adding the styles

  <h2> Why I chose the Techonogies for the Development </h2>
I'm a keen React developer. Even though I started learning React a couple of weeks ago, I'm synonymous with javaScript and familiar with Vue Js, and they give me an edge.
  However, I encountered a few challenges ranging from working with the states and manipulating the store. But, after a deeper understanding, I got down with it.
  And, on a special note, I'm indebted to my eldest brother (@machinepereere) who put in priceless efforts to ensure I'm on the right track.
